 My name is Turkish.

           Funny name for an Englishman, I know.

             My parents were on the same plane  when it crashed. That's how they met.

             They named me after the plane.

             Not many people are  named after a plane crash.

             That's Tommy.

             He tells people  he was named after a gun.

             But I know he was really named after  a famous   th century ballet dancer.

             Known him for as long as I can  remember. He's my partner.

             Doesn't mean we hold hands  or take walks.

             It means I try to keep him out of  as much trouble as he inflicts on me.

             I give him a hard time.  Keeps him in check.

             But really, he's like my brother.

             What do I know about diamonds?  I'm a boxing promoter.

             I was a happy boxing promoter  until a week ago, and then:

             What do I know about diamonds?

             Don't they come from Antwerp?

             - Himy, would you listen to this?  - Do we have a choice?

             It wasn't meant to be taken literally.

             It's a nice story, Adam and Eve.

             It's bound with moral fibre...

             ... but asking a grown man  to believe it?

             What is it?

             Well, what is it?

             What you want I should do,  drop my pants?

             Okay, go through.

             It's a nice story.

             It's just that. Just a story.

             Catholic religion is based  on a mistranslation.

             Enough already. Ruben, say something.

             Listen. Are you busy?  I'll tell you the whole story.

             The Septuagint scholars mistranslated  the Hebrew word for "young woman"...

             ... into the Greek word for "virgin".

             It was an easy mistake to make...

             ... because there was only a subtle  difference in the spelling.

             So, they came up with a prophecy:

             "Behold, the virgin shall conceive  and bear us a son."

             You understand? It was "virgin"  that caught people's attention.

             It's not everyday a virgin conceives  and bears a son.

             But leave that for a couple  of hundred years to stew...

             ... and next thing you know you have  the Holy Catholic Church.

            Oy vay, "what are you saying?"

             I'm saying, just because  it's written...

             ... doesn't make it so.

             Gives them hope. It's not important  whether it's fact or fiction.

             - People like to believe.  - I don't want to hear anymore.

             Anyway, who is it that we're seeing?

             - Michael.  - Hello?

             Mutti.

            Rudy! Rud, Rud, let them in, please.

            Rud, it's okay, let them through.

            - Michael. - Mutti.

            You've kept us waiting for half an hour. Are you trying to give me heartburn?

            Lie down on the floor.

            Get on the floor!

            Lie on the floor!

            Get on the fucking floor!

            - Get down! - Get fucking down!

            Down on the floor! Get down!

            On the ground!

            Get down, I say!

            - Time. - Seven minutes!

            Where is the stone?

            Where is the stone?

            Where is the stone?

            Michael, where is the stone?

            When does your plane leave?

            Twenty minutes.

            Give me your gun.

            When you get to London...

            ...if you want a gun...

            ...call this number.

            - Boris. - Boris.

             He can get you anything you need.

              Is he allowed to do that?

              It's an unlicensed boxing match. It's not a tickling competition.

              These lads are out to hurt each other.

              What's with those sausages, Charlie?

              Two minutes, Turkish.

              Look at it. How am I supposed to run this thing from that?

              We'll need a proper office.

              I want a new one. You're going to buy it for me.

              Why me?

              Well, you know about caravans.

              How's that?

              You spent a summer in one. Which means you know more than me.

              And I don't want to have me pants pulled down over the price.

              What's wrong with this one?

              Oh, nothing, Tommy.

              It's tiptop.

              I'm just not sure about the colour.

              It's all arranged. You just got to pick it up.

              Here's an address.

              It's a campsite.

              You've got    grand, and it would be nice to see change.

              - What's happening with them sausages? - Five minutes.

              It was two minutes five minutes ago.

              They ain't pikeys, are they?

              I fucking hate pikeys.
